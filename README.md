## Project Notes
- We found a customer for our project and received the requirements for the project from our customer. We gathered these requirements as a team and technically documented them. We held a meeting with the customer and shared the technical documentation we made. After receiving approval from the customer, we started writing the necessary product backlogs for the project. After the product backlog writing process was completed, we started our project on October 26, 2023.

 **Software Requirements Specification**:

- As a team, we decided to use Jira in project management, written communication via WhatsApp, and voice communication on Discord.

- We decided to use technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JS to make the front-end part of our project. The main reasons why we choose these back-end technologies are that they are easy to learn and there are many resources on the internet.

- We planned daily scrum meetings for three days: Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday.
- In the first meetings, we determined the most suitable time for the team by opening a survey. And after a few surveys, we decided to set our meeting times around 20:00.
